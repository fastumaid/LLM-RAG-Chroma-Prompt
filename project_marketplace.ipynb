Indeed, service marketplaces have very\\ndifferent needs (quantity, time, geography, etc.) and challenges than product\\nmarketplaces or even a digital service.

When digital services are available everywhere and at any\\ntime, physical services involve a human interaction which trigger the execution and\\ntherefore the sale completion.\\nAt the highest level, all services can be categorized into being commoditized or non-\\ncommoditized.

Background:  E-commerce is one of the most dynamic and importan t sectors of the Polish economy. Its \\ndevelopment is driven by rapidly expanding Internet  access. Worldwide e-commerce is dominated by marke tplaces with \\na great market share. There are both advantages and  disadvantages related to the use of marketplaces, for sellers and \\nbuyers alike. \\nThe aims of this paper are to indicate the nature o f marketplaces, develop a classification for them, and also to indicate \\nnew challenges related to them and development dire ctions in Poland.  \\nMethods:  For the needs of this paper, research was conducte d using the methods of direct observation and analy sis of \\nprimary and secondary sources. The primary material s included data obtained from companies providing m arketplaces in \\nPoland and abroad, and the secondary ones – reports , studies and Internet sources. In addition, in-dep th interviews were \\nperformed with experts on marketplaces. \\nResults:  The article provides a detailed description of mar ketplaces. The authors describe the division and ch aracteristics \\nof marketplaces and discussed the potential trends in this field. It presents marketplace-related bene fits and \\ndisadvantages, and how the authors classify them. \\nConclusions: Marketplaces create new opportunities for expansion  on a larger scale for online sellers. Companies do not \\nneed to invest in a sales platform or have knowledg e of legal aspects. Moreover, they have access to i nnovative solutions. \\nObviously, there are many disadvantages, such as ve ry strong  competition from numerous sellers in one  place, becoming \\ndependent on this sales channel, and neglecting the  growth of the seller's own online shop. \\nKey words:  e-commerce, marketplace, value network. \\n \\n \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe global value of retail e-commerce in \\n2018 reached over USD 2.84 T. In 2019 it is \\nexpected to exceed USD 3.45 T and climb to \\nUSD 4.88 T in 2021 [Statista 2019a]. The \\nshare of e-commerce in retail has been \\ngrowing steadily. Last year, it was 11.9%, \\nreaching 13.7% in 2019 and 17.5% in 2021 \\n[Statista 2019b]. Fashion products (clothes, \\nfootwear, accessories), electronics and media \\n(personal electronics, music, games) are the \\nproducts purchased online most often.  \\nCustomers purchase products both from \\nonline shops and marketplaces, with the latter enjoying particular popularity. Last year, the \\ntop 100 biggest marketplaces generated  \\nturnover of USD 1.86 B. This accounted for \\nover 95% of the revenues across all platforms \\nand around 65% of the world's e-commerce \\ncombined. The massive share of these \\nplatforms and their dynamic growth (23% in \\nrelation to 2017) shows how important they are \\nin shaping e-commerce domestically and \\ninternationally. Of the largest 100 platforms, \\n61 are in the USA, 17 in Asia, 14 in Europe, 5 \\nin South America and 3 in Africa. \\nInterestingly, 59 marketplaces have been \\nfounded in USA and 39 are not older than 9 \\nyears [Ali 2019]. \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These were \\nfollowed by Amazon (USD 344 B), JD.com \\n(USD 259 B) and eBay (USD 96 B) [Ali \\n2019]. Alibaba's turnover stems both from the \\npurchasing power of China and other Asian \\nstates, where the marketplace is active and \\nfrom the amazing popularity of the group's \\nplatforms. 80% of products purchased in China \\nis sold on these portals. Apart from China, \\nmarketplaces had over 50% of market share in \\njust two countries. In Germany, where Amazon \\nhad a 55% market share, and in Poland, with \\nAllegro registering 50% market share \\n[Ecommerce Foundation 2016]. Currently, \\nAllegro's share in Polish e-commerce stands at \\naround 40%. \\nApart from micro and small businesses, \\nmedium-size and large firms also sell their \\nproducts on marketplaces. Recently, more and \\nmore of the largest businesses have been \\njoining marketplaces. These new forms of \\nselling have become an important part of both \\ne-commerce and the entire economy. This is \\nbecause marketplaces eliminate entry barriers \\nto new businesses and the expansion of \\nexisting ones. They also create new solutions \\nand show new directions in the digital \\neconomy. Amazon, Alibaba and JD.com invest \\nbillions in logistics infrastructure, thus helping \\nthe regions where they operate to grow. \\nWhat is the nature of marketplaces and \\nwhat marketplaces other than Allegro are \\navailable in Poland? What new challenges do \\nmarketplaces face and what are their \\ndevelopment directions? These are some of the \\nquestions we will try to address in the article. \\nThe aims of this paper are to indicate the \\nnature of marketplaces, develop an original \\nclassification of them, and to indicate new \\nchallenges they face and development \\ndirections in Poland. \\nThe paper is divided into three main parts. \\nThe first section discusses the nature of \\nmarketplaces, the second presents and \\ndescribes the types of marketplaces, and the \\nthird speaks of the future directions for the \\ndevelopment of marketplaces. For the purpose of this article, the authors \\nconducted research by means of direct \\nobservation and analysis of secondary sources \\nsuch as reports, publications, press materials \\nand marketplace websites. Additionally, the \\narticle draws on the authors’ expert knowledge \\nacquired during over a dozen years of market \\nobservations and the previously conducted \\nanalyses and reports. \\nTHE NATURE OF MARKETPLACES \\nSpeaking in the most general terms, \\na marketplace is a platform that offers products \\nand services of numerous sellers, which can be \\nbought by clients [Tian et al. 2018, Li et al. \\n2019]. Most of the products come from \\nexternal companies, although some platforms \\nalso offer their own products (e.g. Amazon, \\nAllegro). Other businesses must be able to sell \\ntheir products to make the platform \\na marketplace, otherwise it is just an online \\nshop. Sometimes the term “marketplace” is \\nwrongly used for online stores with a very \\nwide selection of products. As previously \\nnoted, marketplaces can also offer services for \\nsale. However, this article focuses on goods, \\nbecause their turnover is more complex and \\nrequires more attention. \\nSellers trade on popular platforms \\nfrequently visited by users in exchange for \\na part of their sales profits. Most often, the \\nmarketplace business model is based on \\ncollecting fees for sales made through them. \\nThese fees differ depending on the platform \\nand the category of products. Some \\nmarketplaces collect fees for listing the product \\n(e.g. Allegro). The sellers agree to such fees, \\nbecause marketplaces allow them to enter the \\nmarket with low financial outlays. \\nConsequently, such platforms are key selling \\nvenues for many sellers. \\nMarketplaces offer undeniable advantages, \\nsuch as prompt access to a lot of clients, high \\nrecognizability, first contact venue (many \\nbuyers start looking for products on \\nmarketplaces), ready technical solutions, \\na payment system and logistics. They are great \\nvenues for testing products and new sales \\nmarkets and for collecting information from \\nclients.

Some of the \\nlimitations are very strong competition (for \\nexample, 363,000 new sellers offering \\nidentical or very similar products joined \\nAmazon in Europe in 2017), listing systems \\n(some online shop suppliers offer integration \\nand automated listings), communication with \\nclients from abroad, and fees. \\nSome marketplaces seek ways of generating \\nadditional revenues other than from sales \\ncommission. One such example may be \\nfulfilment services, consisting in the \\nmarketplace taking over processes related to \\nwarehouse logistics, i.e. receiving goods, \\nstorage, picking, packing, shipping and \\nhandling returns [Semeijn et al. 2005]. This is \\nAmazon’s speciality, as they operate numerous \\nwarehouses across the world. The seller is not \\nobliged to ship their goods to Amazon \\nwarehouses, but this may mean that their \\nlistings are poorly positioned.  \\nThe leading marketplace sellers owe their \\nsuccess to their unique approach to customers [Church, Oakley 2018]. They draw on clients’ \\nemotions and provide them with a product- and \\ndelivery-related experience. The emotional \\naspect applies to lifestyle, fashion, trends and \\nsocial affiliation. This reinforces the \\nrelationship between the client and the \\nplatform. Mainly due to customization, the \\nInternet has made it possible to know clients \\nbetter, in particular their shopping experience, \\nand consequently to adapt the offer to their \\npreferences and to increase their loyalty. \\nLearning the needs of their potential clients \\nallows sellers to offer their products more \\nconsciously. Add-on sales are used for existing \\nclients. This may be take the form of cross-\\nselling, where products from other categories \\n(often of complementary nature) are sold, or \\nselling more expensive or more advanced \\nproducts from the same category (up-selling). \\nAs shown in the analysis, there are both \\nadvantages and disadvantages related to the \\nuse of marketplaces, and both for sellers and \\nthe buyers.

The biggest players offer \\npractically all types of products that can be \\npurchased from bricks & mortar stores. Their \\nplatforms often offer items that are only \\navailable there, e.g. hand-crafted goods. \\nHowever, just like there are specialized online \\nshops, marketplaces also become segmented. \\nConsequently, platforms focusing on specific \\nproducts and business areas have been \\nlaunched, e.g. fashion, electronics, home or \\nhand-crafted items. An omnichannel strategy is \\nyet another emerging trend, based on the \\nseller’s presence in various online and off-line \\nsales channels. Some marketplace owners \\nexpand and launch traditional sales channels, \\nand some of the biggest websites open their \\nown marketplaces.  \\nPrice comparison sites and best deal sites \\nare not marketplaces by definition. Many \\nbuyers start searching for products on websites \\nsuch as: Ceneo.pl, Nokaut.pl, Alleceny.pl, \\nOkazje.info, and Skapiec.pl. Currently, 67% of \\nPolish web users compare prices of products \\nand services and 19% make their first \\npurchases on the basis of results from price comparison sites (Gemius 2018). Every third \\nonline shop in Poland uses price comparison \\nsites as promotion tools [Skorupska 2017]. \\nApart from the price, products are tiered based \\non criteria such as popularity or positive \\nfeedback about the store or the product. As e-\\ncommerce grows, the role of price comparison \\nsites changes. The entire shopping process can \\nnow be conducted on a price comparison site, \\nso such sites are more and more commonly \\ntreated as marketplaces. \\nAnother group of emerging marketplaces \\nare platforms available only to business clients \\n(B2B). The reasons driving both individual and \\nbusiness clients are largely the same. Low \\nprices, time savings and convenience are the \\nmost important ones. Additionally, businesses \\nwant to buy as many goods and services as \\npossible from one place and want to integrate \\ntheir processes with a selected B2B operator. \\nResearch shows that business using online \\npurchasing systems can save up to 15%. \\nToday, only 35% of Polish businesses use such \\nsolutions [Aleo, Deloitte 2017]. \\nThe types of marketplaces, divided \\naccording to various criteria, are presented in \\nTable 3. \\n \\n \\nTable 3.

Many traders find \\nthem convenient, because they attract new \\nclients and provide ways of serving them. \\nThanks to their brand, marketplaces make \\nproducts of less-known sellers more credible. \\nAdditionally, marketplace owners invest \\nheavily in advertising, promotional activities \\nand PR. The seller’s role boils down to \\nproviding information about the listing (which \\nis often transferred automatically to the \\nmarketplace from the seller's system) and \\npreparing the product for shipment (which may \\nbe a part of Amazon's fulfillment service). \\nMarketplaces are also great testing grounds for \\nnew products, as large numbers of clients may \\nbe reached through them without having to \\nincur substantial costs. In the case of \\ninternational marketplaces, sellers may reach \\nforeign buyers without speaking their \\nlanguage, having legal knowledge, logistics \\ninfrastructure etc. \\nA lot of evidence points to marketplaces \\nbeing some of the key actors in the e-\\ncommerce value network. Experts anticipate \\nthat by 2020 around 40% of online trade will \\nbe done through marketplaces [MarkMonitor \\n2016]. Online sellers have no other \\nalternatives. Apart from thinking of developing \\ntheir online business, they also have to consider joining this sales channel or \\nstrengthening their current presence in \\nmarketplaces. Their 40% share of the Polish \\nmarket was reached a long time ago. This is \\nmainly due to the history of our e-commerce, \\nas for many years, Allegro was the buyers’ \\nfirst choice. The sales structure only started to \\nchange with the presence of competition, such \\nas producers, retail networks, professional \\nonline shops and foreign marketplaces.  \\nEvery year, several new marketplaces \\nemerge in Poland. This is possible, because the \\nentry barriers do not seem difficult to cross. \\nUnlike with online shops, no warehouses, \\ngoods or logistics employees are needed. The \\ncost of developing the IT tools is not an \\ninsurmountable obstacle. Upkeep of the site \\nand developing it are the biggest problems. \\nThe optimal scale of operation, building brand \\nawareness and ongoing promotional activities \\nseem to be the key to success. Most new \\nmarketplaces build their potential in the initial \\nstages of operations by offering free of charge \\nservices. However, this can only be done with \\nsignificant financial back-up. Additionally, the \\nlargest marketplaces continue to  improve their \\ntools and go to great lengths to attract and keep \\ntheir clients. Polish e-commerce has seen \\nnumerous promising marketplaces that failed \\nto withstand the pressure from competitors, \\ne.g. Świstak.pl or DaWanda.pl. \\nGiven the stiff competition, new \\nmarketplaces must do everything to stand out \\nin the market. One of the ways to do this is to \\nspecialize in certain fields or products. \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

LogForum 15 (4), 521-\\n529. http://doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2019.351    \\n \\n526  Although marketplaces are very “spacious” \\nand can carry all categories of products, buyers \\nlook for specialized products in specialist \\nshops. It is true that millions of products can be \\nbrowsed on eBay, Amazon or Allegro, but \\nthese sites will not replace vertical platforms \\nwith knowledgeable sellers offering assistance \\nand, often, better prices. This is why some \\nexperts claim that following the development \\nof marketplaces offering a wide range of \\ngoods, more specialized platforms will emerge \\nand be active in respective fields. The \\nbeginnings of this trend can be seen in Poland, \\nas a relatively large number of new \\nmarketplaces have recently emerged in the \\nfashion sector (clothes and footwear). Apart \\nfrom electronics, this is one of the largest \\nsegments of the market and one that keeps \\ngrowing dynamically. Many producers active \\nin this field sell their products themselves. For \\nthem, marketplaces are a great way to \\ncomplement their sales channels, with clients \\nhaving access to a wide assortment of goods in \\none place. Research shows that clients care \\nincreasingly  about a wide range of online \\nsellers and would like to shop in one place. \\nThis follows the one-stop shopping concept, \\nwhere all purchases can be handled in one \\nplace. Apart from that, fashion items are high-\\nmargin goods. The situation is different with \\nelectronics, where the margins are very low \\nand where large retailers known for traditional \\nsales predominate, such as Euro.com.pl, \\nMediaexpert.pl, Mediamarkt.pl or \\nKomputronik.pl. Consequently, there is \\npractically no space in this field for \\na middleman, such as a marketplace, \\nspecializing in electronics. \\nThe dynamic growth of e-commerce means \\nthat it is not only individual clients want to \\nshop online. More and more companies that \\nonly deal with business clients are becoming \\ninterested in this sales channel. This give rise \\nto marketplaces dedicated to B2B. One of the \\nnewest outfits in Poland is OEX24.com, which \\nwas launched in February 2019. This is a B2B \\nplatform that not only allows the listing of \\nproducts for domestic and international \\nmarkets, but also deals with customer service \\nand logistics processes. With its platform, \\nOEX wants to cover the entire e-commerce \\nvalue chain – from supplier management \\nthrough sales to handling returns.  More marketplaces should be expected to \\nbe launched soon by sellers who are well \\nknown in the market, and who have significant \\npotential in the form of networks of suppliers, \\nhuman resources, IT and clients. They will be \\nable to expand their product portfolio with \\na new, complementary assortment. This will \\ndrive more traffic on their websites and be \\na source of additional revenues. A good \\nexample of this might be IKEA, which is \\nconsidering starting their own marketplace. \\nIKEA wants to sell its own products and  \\nproducts from other retailers on the \\nmarketplace. The offer will not be limited to \\nfurniture, but will also include home-related \\nitems, in particular DIY and art merchandise. \\nIKEA has been testing sales on Alibaba and \\nAmazon, apparently, with good success. \\nHowever, creating such a marketplace will be \\na challenge for IKEA, as other furniture \\nproducers and distributors will have to be \\ninvited to cooperate. IKEA has declared that \\nno negotiations with their competitors are \\ncurrently taking place, but apparently, they are \\ninterested in creating a sales platform for the \\nentire industry [Fedorenko 2019]. \\nWe should also be mindful of competition \\nthat marketplaces face from tech companies. \\nFacebook, enjoying great popularity in Poland, \\nruns its own marketplace. The service operates \\nlike a noticeboard similar to OLX.pl and \\nGumtree.pl. It connects sellers and buyers who \\nlive close by to start the transaction online and \\ncomplete it in person during pick-up. It is \\nmostly used by individual clients [Wei et al. \\n2019]. Marketplaces face more danger from \\nGoogle Shopping. So far, Google in Poland \\nhas been collecting data about products, \\naggregating them, showing them as Product \\nListing Ads (ads displayed at the top of the \\nGoogle search engine page) and redirecting to \\nonline sellers. At the beginning of 2019, \\nGoogle announced they were planning to \\nlaunch their own marketplace, which, apart \\nfrom listing offers, will handle payments and \\nprovide integration with other solutions. \\nSellers will be responsible for customer service \\nand logistics. Google is planning to test the \\nnew solution first in France. If these tests are \\nconcluded successfully, we can expect to see \\nthe platform in Poland, too.

LogForum 15 (4), 521-\\n529. http://doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2019.351   \\n \\n527  \\n Today, the keys to success in e-commerce \\nare technology and logistics [Bask, Lipponen, \\nTinnilä 2012]. Marketplaces will continue to \\ninvest in these two fields in the coming years. \\nExperts expect marketplaces to keep growing \\nin the field of artificial intelligence (AI), \\nmachine learning and real-time personalization \\n[Columbus 2018]. With regard to logistics, the \\nfocus will be on making shipments quicker and \\ncheaper, offering warehousing services, \\npicking and handling returns. Some related \\nactivities can be seen on Allegro in this regard. \\nIn March 2019, Francois Nuyts, Allegro’s \\nCEO, announced several new solutions. Their \\nobjective is to turn the marketplace into a sort \\nof an ecosystem comprised of sellers and \\nproviders of complementary services. One of \\nthe proposals for change will be a tool with \\nwhich sellers will be able to analyse their own \\nbusiness against the competition. More \\nattention will be paid to evaluating the sellers \\nin terms of logistics –  the time of shipment \\nand delivery, along with return possibilities \\nwill be scored. Allegro also wants to \\nimplement uniform standards for providers of \\nlogistics services with regard to delivery time. \\nSame-day delivery is to be available in \\nselected places. Delayed payment for goods \\npurchased is to be a breakthrough solution. \\nThis way, the client will have 30 days from the \\ndate of delivery to pay for their order. Credit \\nwill not only be extended to clients, but also to \\nsellers, e.g. through a working capital facility \\nand a revolving facility. \\nThe world's biggest shopping platforms, \\nAlibaba and Amazon, are going one step \\nfurther with regard to logistics. Alibaba has \\nalready built numerous warehouses where they \\nperform fulfilment services for their sellers, \\nwhile continuing to invest in new technologies \\nand expand into new markets. The company is \\ncurrently at the acquisition stage and is \\nbroadening its logistics services. Recently, \\nAlibaba bought 14% of shares in STO Express, \\nthe fifth largest Chinese carrier. Previously, the \\ncompany had also bought shares in YTO \\nExpress Group, Best Inc. and ZTO Express \\n[Kapadia 2019]. \\nIt has been known for quite some time that \\nAmazon is aiming at the position of the leader \\nin logistics services. The evidence for this is \\nthe company's own warehouse, fleet of trucks, own airline, drone delivery system and \\nnumerous patents related to logistics and last-\\nmile management, which is the most complex \\nand costly element of the entire logistics \\nprocess in e-commerce. In the USA, Amazon \\nhas its own parcel lockers and courier vehicles, \\nwhich reduces the number of parcels handled \\nby courier operators. Recently, the company \\nalso launched courier services in Europe, \\nnamely in France, Germany, GB and Austria. \\nThis expansion caused DHL to withdraw their \\noperations from Austria and made the Austrian \\npostal service apprehensive as to their own \\nfuture in this market [CEP-Research, 2019]. \\nAmazon may repeat these steps when they \\nlaunch sales in Poland. Consequently, the \\ncourier, express and parcel sector should be \\nready for this scenario. \\nWhen analysing the growth of marketplaces \\nin Poland, we should also remember about the \\nvery dynamic development and growing \\npopularity of other, foreign platforms in \\nPoland. GearBest.com, Wish.com and \\nBanggood.com are some of these. \\nSUMMARY \\nThis study extends current understanding of \\nthe essence of marketplaces in e-commerce. It \\ndevelops an original approach to marketplace \\nclassification to facilitate a better \\nunderstanding of their wide range. Moreover, it \\nindicates their advantages  and disadvantages.  \\nThanks to marketplaces, trade in Poland has \\nbecome easier and more convenient than ever \\nbefore. Its beneficiaries are both companies \\nand customers. Almost each firm has the \\npotential to become a successful trader. \\nMarketplaces create new opportunities for \\nalready existing entities to expand on a larger \\nscale and offers prospects for rapid \\ndevelopment to emerging entities. This is \\npossible due to low entry barriers that \\nencourage more and more companies to sell \\ntheir products on the Internet. They can offer \\na wider range of products without great effort. \\nCompanies are able to save on both fixed and \\nvariable costs, such as rent, labour and other \\noverheads associated with the presence on their \\nown websites.
